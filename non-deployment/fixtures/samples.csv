"Good evening. This is the 37th time I've spoken to you from this office where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this nation. Each time I've done so to discuss with you some matters that I believed affected the national interest. In all the decisions I've made in my public life, I've always tried to do what was best for the nation. As long as there was such a base, I've felt strongly that it was nessesary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion, that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process. But with the disappearance and the dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future, I've concluded that because of the Watergate matter, I might not have the support of the congress, that I'd consider nessesary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interest of the nation would require.","Nixon, Richard M.","Unknown"

"I was a bum at San Francisco that once managed to go to a symphony concert along with the well dressed people. And the music was good but something about the audience was not. And something about the orchestra and the conductor was not. Although the building was fine and the acoustic 's perfect I prefered to listen to the music alone on my radio. And afterwards I did go back to my room. I turned on the radio. But there was a pounding on the wall. 'Shut that god damn thing off.' There was a soldier in the next room bubbling with his wife and soon he would go over there to protect me from Hitler. So I snapped the radio off and then I heard his wife say 'You shouldn't have done that'. And the soldier said 'Fuck that guy' which I thought was a very nice thing for him to tell his wife to do. Of course she never did. Anyhow I never went to another live concert. At that night I listened to the radio very quietly","Bukowski, Charles","Unknown"

It started to come into my chin and into my nose. And when I woke up, my body was all greasy from the holy oil she used to put on my body. I remember being disappointed I survived. When I was five, my father took me to a friend of his, and for no reason at all I hit him right in the stomach. with all my strength. He died a year later. He'll kill you if he gets a chance.

You can try to prove that Columbus sailed on an ocean, but it's not the same ocean; it's a different ocean. It's a different world. Every day, every reality is a new reality. Every new reality is a - is a new horizon, a brand-new experience of living. I got a note last night from a friend of mine. He writes in his note that he's afraid of what he might have to do in order to save his reality, as I saved mine. You can't prove anything; there's nothing to prove. Every man judges himself. He knows what he is. You know what you are as I know what I am. We all know what we are. Nobody can stand in judgement they can play like they're standing in judgement. They can play like they stand in judgement and take you off and control the masses with your human body and they can lock you up in penitentiaries and cages and put you on crosses like they did in the past. But it doesn't amount to anything. What they're doing is, they're only persecuting our affliction of themselves. They're persecuting what they can't stand to look at in themselves: the truth! They can't stand to look at the truth in themselves, they persecute themselves. They're butchering themselves every time they go on the freeway. They hate themselves. Look at the signs. Stop, go, turn here, turn there, you can't do this, you can't do that, you can't, you can't, you can't, this is illegal, that's illegal, everything's illegal. The police used to watch over the people; now they're watching the people. The president doesn't represent the people; he could be on the roadside picking up his children but he isn't. He's in the White House sending them off to war. And you're saying I have to pay for this again, and again and again: I've gotta pay for your sins. How many times have I gotta pay for your sins?

"On the afternoon of August 18, 1973, five young people in a Volkswagen van ran out of gas on a farm road in south Texas. Four of them were never seen again. The next morning the one survivor, Sally Hardesty Annright, was picked up on a roadside, blood-caked and screaming murder. Sally said she had broken out of a window in Hell. The girl babbled a mad tale. A cannibal family in an isolated farmhouse. Chainsawed fingers and bones. Her brother, her friends, hacked up for barbecue. Chairs made of human skeletons. Then she sank into catatonia. Texas lawmen mounted a month-long manhunt, but could not locate the macabre farmhouse. They could find no killers and no victims. No facts. No crime. Officially, on the records, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre never happened. But during the last thirteen years, over and over again, reports of bizarre grisly chainsaw mass murders have persisted all across the state of Texas. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has not stopped. It haunts Texas. It seems to have no end.","Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, The","Unknown"

"The Hindenburg left Frankfurt, Germany yesterday, sorry tuesday, 7.30 their time, and for the better than two & a half days they have been speeding through the skies over miles and miles of water here to America. Now they are coming in to make a landing of the zeppelin. At this point I'm going to step out here and cover it from the outside, so as I move out... we'll stand by a second. Well, here it comes ladies & gentlemen, we're out now, outside the hangar, and what a great sight it is, a thrilling one, its a marvellous sight, as it comes down out of the sky, pointing directly toward us and toward the mooring mast, the mighty vehicle coming down now... the huge propellers scything the air and throwing it back into a gale-like whirlpool. No wonder this floating palace has moved with such speed with' these powerful motors behind it. The field wasn't active when we arrved but the field has become a moving mass of cooperative action, with the landing crews and mooring crews, with orders being passed along, and last minute preparations are being completed for the moment we've waited for so long. The ship is riding majestically toward us like some great feather, riding as though it were mighty proud to take its place in the world of aviation. The ship is no doubt bustling with activity as we can see, the pasengers are lining the windows looking down toward us and getting a glimpse of the mooring mast. Its practically standing still now as they have dropped ropes out of the nose of the ship and these have been taken ahold of down here on the field by a number of men... It's starting to rain again, the rain has dragged up a little bit. The vast motors of the ship are just holding it enough to keep it --- It's bursting into flames!!! - Get it Scotty, get it!!! It's terrible!!! Oh my get out of the way please... Its burning, bursting into flames and falling onto the field. Oh this is terrible, one of the worst catastrophes the world has ever seen... The flames are rising 4 to 5 hundred feet into the sky, its a terrific blaze ladies & gentlemen, the smoke and the flames now, the ship crashing to the ground and not quite into the mooring mast... oh the humanity... all the passengers... it's it's... oh... I... I... I can't talk ladies & gentlemen, honestly... A great mass of smoking wreckage and everybody can hardly breathe... I'm sorry.. I... I... I can hardly breathe...

Seems a thousand centuries ago... We went into a camp to innoculate the children. We left the camp after we had innoculated the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He couldn't see. We went back there and they had come and hacked off every innoculated arm. There they were in a pile... A pile of little arms. And I remember... I... I... I cried... I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do. And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. And then I realized... Like I was shot... Like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet right through my forehead... And I thought: My God...the genius of that. The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we. Because they could stand that these were not monsters... These were men... trained cadres... these men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love...but they had the strength...the strength...to do that.","Apocalypse Now","Unknown"
